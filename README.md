Wine Quality Test using ML
Wine quality testing using machine learning algorithms involves building predictive models that can classify wines into different quality categories based on their features. Let's explore the three algorithms you mentioned:

### 1. **Logistic Regression**
Logistic regression is a linear model commonly used for binary classification problems, but it can also be extended to multiclass classification. It predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class.

### 2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies a new instance based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.

- **Advantages:**
  - Simple and intuitive.
  - No training phase; the model is essentially the training data.

### 3. **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**
Gaussian Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming that the features are independent and normally distributed.

- **Advantages:**
  - Fast and efficient.
  - Works well with small datasets and high-dimensional data.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset (e.g., wine quality dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository).
   - Handle missing values, if any.
   - Standardize or normalize features if necessary.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Select relevant features based on domain knowledge or feature selection techniques.

3. **Splitting the Data:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Train Logistic Regression, KNN, and GaussianNB models on the training set.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing set.

6. **Model Selection:**
   - Compare the models and select the best one based on the evaluation metrics.
